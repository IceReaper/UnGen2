# C&C Generals 2 data library and viewer.

**This project does NOT make the game playable in any way!**

The primary goal of this project is to fully parse every single asset in the C&C Generals 2 Alpha for preservation purposes.

Current state:
- [X] Read the CAT/CAS asset containers
- [X] Decrypt and read the data containers
- [X] Implement the CAS compressions
- [ ] Figure out filenames and filetypes
- [ ] Insert all filetypes to this list
- [ ] Fully parse the asset formats
- [ ] Refactor project into a loader library and a viewer gui application.
